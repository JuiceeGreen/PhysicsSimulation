A physics simulation project made in C++ using the Allegro library to display graphics. Currently uses Newtonian Gravity.

Simulates
- Projectile motion
- Celestial motion

Working on
- Creating simulations for high energy particle collisions close to the speed of light.
- Incorporating simulations for Einstein's relativity.
